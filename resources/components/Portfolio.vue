            <h2>My <strong>work</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Most of my work was done as a part of a organisation which can't be shared publicily ðŸ˜ž. Now, while this page is in the works, probably start with technologies used on this site.
                This site is hosted on Netlify, NuxtJS(Vue Framework) and Bootstrap4 (Scss). The codebase is on my GitHub neveenaferrao/portfolio-site-nuxt-app.
                You can also download a copy of resume or check out my GitHub for other projects.
            </p>

                If you're still not convinced or you're just curious about some of my other work, feel free to send me a mail at <a href="mailto:neveena.praveen@gmail.com">neveena.praveen@gmail.com</a>.
